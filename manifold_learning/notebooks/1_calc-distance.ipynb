    "The @dataclass decorator is a feature introduced in Python 3.7 as part of the dataclasses module. It is used to automatically generate special methods for classes that primarily store data, such as __init__, __repr__, __eq__, and __hash__ among others. This simplifies the process of creating classes that are mostly used as containers for data fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a quick overview of when and why we might use @dataclass:\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use @dataclass:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simplifying Class Definitions: When we have a class that primarily serves to hold data with little to no functionality (methods) beyond storing that data. Traditional classes require manually defining methods like __init__ and __repr__ to make them useful, which can be verbose and repetitive for simple data containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Automatic Method Generation: If we want Python to automatically generate __init__, __repr__, __eq__, and optionally __hash__ methods for us, based on the class fields we define. This can save time and reduce errors in boilerplate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Immutability Option: When we need immutable instances, we can use the frozen parameter (@dataclass(frozen=True)) to make the instances of our class immutable. This is useful for creating objects that should not change after they are created, similar to tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Type Hints Integration: @dataclass works well with type hints, allowing us to specify the type of each field in your class, which can improve code readability and help with static type checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FilterParams class is a Python data class designed to encapsulate parameters and functionality for creating image filters, specifically Gaussian and Butterworth filters. The class uses Python's @dataclass decorator from the dataclasses module, which automatically adds special methods including __init__, __repr__, and others to the class based on the defined fields. This makes it easier to work with instances of the class without having to manually define these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "1. method: A string indicating the type of filter to create. It supports 'Gauss' for Gaussian filters and 'Butter' for Butterworth filters.\n",
    "2. cutoff_freq: A floating-point number representing the Nyquist cutoff frequency of the filter.\n",
    "3. order: An integer specifying the order of the filter. This is applicable only for Butterworth filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: create_filter\n",
    "The create_filter method takes a 2D NumPy array Q, which represents the frequency domain coordinates, and returns a 2D NumPy array representing the filter in the frequency domain.\n",
    "If method is 'Gauss', it calculates the Gaussian filter.\n",

This function is particularly useful in image processing tasks where rotation without losing parts of the image or introducing empty (black) borders is desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "1. img: A 2D NumPy array representing the image to be rotated. The shape of img is expected to be square (*,*), meaning the number of rows and columns should be equal.\n",
    "2. angle: A floating-point value representing the angle (in degrees) by which the image should be rotated.\n",

    "Process\n",

    "1. Determine Image Size: The function first determines the size (n_pix) of the input image by accessing its shape. Since the image is expected to be square, either dimension can be used to find the size.\n",
    "2. Create an Expanded Image: The input image is tiled (repeated) 3 times both horizontally and vertically using np.tile(img, (3, 3)). This creates a larger image composed of 9 copies of the original image arranged in a 3x3 grid. This step is crucial for ensuring that rotating the image does not introduce empty borders and that the central part of the image still contains relevant content after rotation.\n",
    "3. Convert to PIL Image: The expanded NumPy array is converted to a PIL (Python Imaging Library, now known as Pillow) image using Image.fromarray(...). This conversion is necessary because the rotation is performed using PIL's rotate method, which provides more flexibility and options for image manipulation compared to NumPy's capabilities.\n",
    "4. Rotate the Image: The expanded image is rotated by the specified angle using PIL's rotate method. The expand=False parameter indicates that the output image should not be resized to fit the rotated image; instead, the rotated image will be cropped to the original expanded image size.\n",
    "5. Extract the Central Part: After rotation, the central part of the rotated image is extracted. This is done by selecting the middle third of the image in both dimensions, effectively returning to the original image size but with the content rotated. This step ensures that the output image does not contain any empty borders introduced by rotation and maintains the original image size.\n",

The grid is centered around (0, 0) because of how a is constructed.\n",
    "3. Calculate Normalized Distances: The function calculates the Euclidean distance from the center for each point in the grid using the formula sqrt(X^2 + Y^2). This distance is then normalized by dividing by N, the size of the grid, and multiplied by 2 to scale the distances appropriately.\n",

    "The projection direction data represents the orientations of particles or images in 3D space, as captured in cryo-electron microscopy. These orientations are critical for reconstructing the 3D structure of the imaged object (e.g., a protein or virus) from 2D projections. The projection directions are often represented on a unit sphere (S2), where each point on the sphere corresponds to a unique orientation in 3D space.\n",

    "How Projection Direction Data is Calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From Euler Angles: Projection directions can be derived from Euler angles provided in the metadata of cryo-EM datasets. Euler angles (rotation, tilt, and psi) describe the orientation of each particle image relative to a reference orientation. These angles can be converted into points on a unit sphere representing the direction from which each particle was \"viewed.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Quaternion Representation: Alternatively, orientations can be represented using quaternions, a mathematical notation that avoids the gimbal lock problem associated with Euler angles. Quaternions are converted into points on the unit sphere, similar to the conversion from Euler angles.\n",

    "For some analyses, it might be necessary to distribute points uniformly on the unit sphere to understand the coverage of projection directions. This can be achieved through algorithms designed for uniform distribution on spheres."

    "Understanding Projection Direction Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Projection directions refer to the orientations from which 2D images (projections) of a 3D object are taken. In cryo-EM, for example, each 2D image is a projection of the 3D structure of a molecule captured from a specific direction. These directions can be represented as points on a unit sphere, where each point corresponds to a direction in 3D space from which the projection was taken.\n",

    "How Projection Direction Data is Calculated\n",

    "The calculation or determination of projection directions often involves analyzing the metadata associated with each image, which includes rotation angles or other orientation parameters. These parameters can be converted into points on a unit sphere using spherical coordinates or other relevant transformations. In some cases, the directions are directly provided or can be inferred from the experimental setup."
