This step groups images by their structural similarities, facilitating the analysis of the molecule's different conformations."

    "The core of the process is manifold embedding, where the high-dimensional cloud of points (each representing an image) is analyzed to understand the manifold it formsâ€”a mathematical construct that represents the continuous variations in the molecule's structure. This step involves reducing the dimensionality of the data (simplifying the complex relationships) while preserving the intrinsic characteristics that define the molecule's structural changes."

This step involves finding a smaller, more manageable set of dimensions (Euclidean coordinates) that still accurately describes the manifold's structure."

    "Molecules like enzymes, ribosomes, and other biological macromolecules often undergo changes in their structure that are not simply \"on\" or \"off\" but involve a smooth transition between states. These transitions can involve folding, bending, twisting, or other movements that enable the molecule to perform its biological function."

While categorizations like these are helpful for simplification, they can miss the subtleties of the transition between states, which can be crucial for understanding the molecule's function."

    "Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis or more sophisticated nonlinear methods reduce the manifold's dimensionality to a more manageable size while preserving the relationships between points.\n",
    "#### Continuous Mapping\n",
    "The reduced-dimensionality space provides a map where each point corresponds to a state of the molecule, and the distance between points reflects the degree of difference between these states. This space can reveal the continuous path a molecule follows as it transitions between conformations.\n",
    "#### Visualizing the Path\n",
    "We can now visualize a continuous trajectory that the molecule takes through its conformational space. This trajectory can reveal intermediate states that might be critical for the molecule's function but are not easily categorized into discrete states."

    "Finally, the information from manifolds corresponding to different projection directions is consolidated into a unified map of the molecule's conformational landscape. This involves connecting points that represent the same conformation but are viewed from different angles and adjusting for the rates of conformational change across different dimensions to create a coherent, comprehensive model of the molecule's structure."
